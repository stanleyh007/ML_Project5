## 1: Business Case

Question: Given stock market data from previous days, is it possible to predict what it will look like tomorrow evening?

We believe that it is an interesting question because naturally, while you can see what the stock prices are when you wake up, if you're able to predict what they will look like later on in the day, it's possible to game the system in a sense. From our standpoint, if we're able to do so, we could potentially play the stockmarket. It's a pipe dream but it's also an interesting experiment.

One of the topics from the lessons that we feel will be most important for this case is Accuracy. After all, if we can't be accurate with our predictions, there wouldn't be a reason for us to take the data seriously.
