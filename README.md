# Project5 -  Final exam project


## Business Case

### Before Case start
Question: Given stock market data from previous days, is it possible to predict what it will look like in the nearly furture?

We believe that it is an interesting question because naturally, while you can see what the stock prices are when you wake up, if you're able to predict what they will look like later on in the day, it's possible to game the system in a sense. From our standpoint, if we're able to do so, we could potentially play the stockmarket. It's a pipe dream but it's also an interesting experiment.

## After we made it
We tried to make it happened, but it seems like the forecast in this way does not make sense, even our model looks very good to predict the historical records.
Stocks is not that easy, just by using the prices of previous years to forecast the nearly furture. Stocks can be affect by many factors i.e., company reports and news, marked news and global news etc.. 

We want to add more features that can help the model to understand the impact from **REAL WORLD**. We will add more results to this case to compare and find out what is the best possible way to forecast a stock.
